% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{C:\Users\Administrator\Pictures}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
   \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no

  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

In TCP/IP networks, there is no inherent support for Quality of Service.
Routing is done on the minimum hop count from sender to receiver, and all traffic is best-effort traffic. 
This is unsatisfactory for applications such as video streaming. 
This paper presents an OpenFlow controller application which provides 
Quality of Service (\textit{QoS}) support for video streaming using Scalable Video Coding (\textit{SVC}) in an OpenFlow network. 
First we route the base layer of SVC encoded videos as a 
high priority QoS flow while the enhancement layers are routed at a lower QoS or as a best-effort flow. 
Second, we provide failure recovery so the OpenFlow network can converge back to an optimal 
state when links fail. We show that using different costs to calculate paths for different flows 
can improve the overall throughput of video streams when network congestion and delay occur.
\end{abstract}
% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the conference you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on
% math in the abstract anyway.

\section{Introduction}
In a TCP/IP-based network, each router or switch contains a flow table containing the 
next hop for each destination, based on the shortest path calculation. 
Media applications, such as video streaming, 
require no packet loss and minimal network delay. 
When these video flows are sent over the same path as other best effort traffic they 
are subject to network congestion and delay which renders an unsatisfactory outcome. 
Several efforts have been made to give precedence to certain types of traffic, defined as Quality of Service (QoS).
There are solutions available for QoS support in a TCP/IP-based network, 
such as DiffServ \cite{diffserv} and IntServ \cite{intserv}, but these 
solutions only work well in managed networks.
Scalable Video Coding (SVC) \cite{schwarz2007overview} encodes the stream in a base layer along with several enhancement layers. 
In order to obtain qualitative video streams, it is important that the base layer has no 
packet loss and minimal delay, which is not possible without support for QoS. 
To solve this issue we need the routing algorithms to detect QoS flows and route these flows differently than 
normal best effort traffic.
To achieve this goal in video streaming, we route the base layer of SVC encoded video at a high QoS 
while the enhancement layers are routed either at a lower QoS or as a best effort flow. 
We also provide failure recovery so the network 
can converge back to an optimal state when links fail.\\

We use OpenFlow \cite{mckeown2008openflow} in order to provide QoS support for scalable video streaming. 
OpenFlow is a protocol for switches, allowing to control the packet forwarding process.
This way, networks are not only configurable, but also programmable.
Each OpenFlow Switch has a flow table, which is used for packet lookup and 
forwarding, and a secure channel to an external controller (see Figure \ref{fig:openflow1}). 
The flow table consists of flow entries.
Each flow table entry matches a traffic pattern, by matching the header fields.
The header fields that can be matched in OpenFlow 1.0 can be seen in Table \ref{tab:matchedflows}.
The controller makes the network programmable by managing the switch over 
the secure channel using the OpenFlow protocol.
The controller installs new entries in the flow table to manage the network traffic.
Entries have a hard and a soft timeout. A soft timeout means the entry gets removed if it has not been used for a certain time.
A hard timeout means the flow will be removed after the timeout, even if it is still in use.
There are many implementations of controllers available for OpenFlow switches.
The implementation of the controller we will use is Floodlight \cite{floodlight}, because it is open source and widely used.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
In Section II of this paper we compare related work to our own. 
In section III we take a closer look at the components of our framework 
and the principals it is based on. In section IV we present the different algorithms 
used to determine the behavior of each flow in the network. Section V shows the test 
scenario we used to evaluate our framework while Section VI presents results.
In Section VII we come to a conclusion.

\section{Related work}
In our research we identified a need for separate forwarding actions per flow.
In \cite{wang2011openflow} the aim was to apply load-balancing during service discovery of web services 
when all requests had to be processed by a central component.
A problem occurs when each request is forwarded to a centralized component responsible 
for service discovery, which leads to network congestion. By using OpenFlow, the researchers at 
Princeton University managed to set separate forwarding actions for client requests which match 
certain criteria. These actions allow forwarding entities to redirect client requests to an 
appropriate service instance without interference from the centralized component. Even though 
the use case may be different, the principal is the same as the one applied in our research. 
When both best effort and QoS flows follow the same paths, chances for congestion and packet loss 
to occur increase significantly. OpenFlow allows us to set different paths for both flows, which 
improves the throughput of our QoS flows and also decrease the network load on links used by best 
effort traffic.\\

The idea to provide a minimal quality for SVC encoded videos originates from 
research described in [4] and [5]. By routing the base layer as a lossless-QoS flow we can 
guarantee a minimal quality to the user. Ideally, the enhancement layers will also be delivered 
without packet loss or delay but when congestion occurs we demote the enhancement layers to best 
effort traffic and prioritize the base layer. Research discussed in [4] also attempts to route 
the enhancement layers as a lossy-QoS flow. Our research goes further and also enables fast failure 
recovery when a link fails.\\

\section{Architecture}
Each OpenFlow network contains at least one controller which is responsible for managing all the switches. 
A default OpenFlow switch forwards packets 
to the controller if the packet does not match any forwarding entry. 
We route SVC encoded video streams as a QoS flow, where we consider the base layer as a 
high priority QoS flow and the enhancement layer as either a lower QoS flow or as best effort traffic. 
These principals are shown in Figure \ref{fig_sim}. A filter on the controller separates QoS flows from 
other traffic, after which the controller can choose a path for the different layers. 
When the controller calculates a path for a layer, the new forwarding rules are sent to the switches.\\

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig/SVC_OpenFlow_flow}
\caption{Simulation Results}
\label{fig_sim}
\end{figure}

We defined a cost function which can be used to calculate the cost of a path.
The cost function is based on the following observations. (Insert ref here)
\begin{itemize}
	\item When high priority QoS flows are forwarded on the same link as best effort traffic, there will be packet loss in the best effort flow to prioritize the QoS flow.
	\item Metrics for QoS flows must be different than those used for best effort traffic. The shortest path and QoS path must be different to obtain good results. 
	If both follow the same path, the best effort traffic will experience more packet loss.
	\item Calculating a path for a new QoS flow does not change the best effort routing tables. The packet loss of best effort traffic caused by QoS flows must be considered during path selection.
	\item The length of alternative paths for QoS flows should still be kept as short as possible to optimize transfer time.
	\item Best effort traffic can be used as a reference to retrieve metrics from a switch or link, such as packet loss or to estimate the amount of traffic on that route.
\end{itemize}

These observations show that packet loss and path length are part of our cost function: 
the cost function must find a balance between maintaining low packet loss of the best effort 
traffic and the delay of QoS flows, caused by using longer paths.\\

Furthermore, the controller 
must be able to obtain these metrics at any time from any switch in the network before calculating 
new flow tables. We implemented a monitor module on the controller to gather all network 
statistics. Besides polling for statistics, a switch must also forward events to the controller when 
they occur, such as an link going down or a flow experiencing packet loss. These events provide 
additional monitoring data for the routing algorithms on the controller.\\

\section{QoS Routing}
Must ensure zero packet loss base layer, optimize other traffic ... cost function?
Go from theoretical cost function to exact function in code?
--> Yes


\section{Evaluation}
Test scenario (client/server - filter based on port) + metrics for result + present results\\
An evaluation metric has to represent a value which is relevant to what we want to improve, which is why a measurement must:
\begin{itemize}
	\item represent the quality of the received video
	\item represent the performance of the network
	\item represent the impact on best effort traffic
\end{itemize}
To measure quality of the video we have chosen for the PSNR value of the received video compared to the raw footage. The higher the PSNR value, the better the frames were preserved during transfer. To measure the performance of the network we used the bitrate of all traffic. We also show the packet loss of best effort traffic caused by prioritizing the QoS flow...

% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.






% conference papers do not normally have an appendix


% use section* for acknowledgement
%\section*{Acknowledgment}
%The authors would like to thank...





% trigger a \newpage just before the given reference
% number - used to balance the columns on the last page
% adjust value as needed - may need to be readjusted if
% the document is modified later

% The "triggered" command can be changed if desired:
%\IEEEtriggercmd{\enlargethispage{-5in}}
