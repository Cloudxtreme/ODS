.SH NAME
ovs\-dpctl \- administer Open vSwitch datapaths
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ovs\-dpctl
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIcommand \fR[\fIswitch\fR] [\fIargs\fR\&...]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBovs\-dpctl\fR program can create, modify, and delete Open vSwitch
datapaths.  A single machine may host up to 256 datapaths (numbered 0
to 255).
.PP
A newly created datapath is associated with only one network device, a
virtual network device sometimes called the datapath's ``local port''.
A newly created datapath is not, however, associated with any of the
host's other network devices.  To intercept and process traffic on a
given network device, use the \fBadd\-if\fR command to explicitly add
that network device to the datapath.
.PP
Do not use \fBovs\-dpctl\fR commands to modify datapaths if
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR(8) is in use.  Instead, modify the
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR configuration file and send \fBSIGHUP\fR to the
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR process.
.PP
Most \fBovs\-dpctl\fR commands that work with datapaths take an argument
that specifies the name of the datapath, in one of the following
forms:
.RS
.TP
[\fItype\fB@\fR]\fBdp\fIN\fR
Datapath number \fIN\fR, where \fIN\fR is a number between 0 and 255,
inclusive.  If \fItype\fR is given, it specifies the datapath provider of
\fBdp\fIN\fR, otherwise the default provider \fBsystem\fR is assumed.
.
.TP
[\fItype\fB@\fR]\fIname\fR
The name of the network device associated with the datapath's local
port.  (\fB\*(PN\fR internally converts this into a datapath number,
as above.)  If \fItype\fR is given, it specifies the datapath provider of
\fIname\fR, otherwise the default provider \fBsystem\fR is assumed.
.RE
.PP
The following commands manage datapaths.
.
.TP
\fBadd\-dp \fIdp\fR [\fInetdev\fR...]
Creates datapath \fIdp\fR.  The name of the new datapath's local port
depends on how \fIdp\fR is specified: if it takes the form
\fBdp\fIN\fR, the local port will be named \fBdp\fIN\fR; otherwise,
the local port's name will be \fIdp\fR.
.IP
This will fail if the host already has 256 datapaths, if a network
device with the same name as the new datapath's local port already
exists, or if \fIdp\fR is given in the form \fBdp\fIN\fR
and a datapath numbered \fIN\fR already exists.
.IP
If \fInetdev\fRs are specified, \fBovs\-dpctl\fR adds them to the datapath.
.
.TP
\fBdel\-dp \fIdp\fR
Deletes datapath \fIdp\fR.  If \fIdp\fR is associated with any network
devices, they are automatically removed.
.
.TP
\fBadd\-if \fIdp netdev\fR[\fIoption\fR...]...
Adds each \fInetdev\fR to the set of network devices datapath
\fIdp\fR monitors, where \fIdp\fR is the name of an existing
datapath, and \fInetdev\fR is the name of one of the host's
network devices, e.g. \fBeth0\fR.  Once a network device has been added
to a datapath, the datapath has complete ownership of the network device's
traffic and the network device appears silent to the rest of the
system.
.IP
A \fInetdev\fR may be followed by a comma-separated list of options.
The following options are currently supported:
.
.RS
.IP "\fBinternal\fR"
Instead of attaching an existing \fInetdev\fR, creates an internal
port (analogous to the local port) with that name.
.RE
.
.TP
\fBdel\-if \fIdp netdev\fR...
Removes each \fInetdev\fR from the list of network devices datapath
\fIdp\fR monitors.
.
.TP
\fBdump\-dps\fR
Prints the name of each configured datapath on a separate line.
.
.TP
\fBshow \fR[\fIdp\fR...]
Prints a summary of configured datapaths, including their datapath
numbers and a list of ports connected to each datapath.  (The local
port is identified as port 0.)
.IP
If one or more datapaths are specified, information on only those
datapaths are displayed.  Otherwise, \fBovs\-dpctl\fR displays information
about all configured datapaths.
.
.IP "\fBdump\-flows \fIdp\fR"
Prints to the console all flow entries in datapath \fIdp\fR's
flow table.
.IP
This command is primarily useful for debugging Open vSwitch.  The flow
table entries that it displays are not
OpenFlow flow entries.  Instead, they are different and considerably
simpler flows maintained by the Open vSwitch kernel module.
.IP "\fBdel\-flows \fIdp\fR"
Deletes all flow entries from datapath \fIdp\fR's flow table.
.IP
This command is primarily useful for debugging Open vSwitch.  As
discussed in \fBdump\-flows\fR, these entries are
not OpenFlow flow entries.  By deleting them, the process that set them
up may be confused about their disappearance.
.
.IP "\fBdump\-groups \fIdp\fR"
Prints to the console the sets of port groups maintained by datapath
\fIdp\fR.  Ordinarily there are at least 2 port groups in a datapath
that \fBovs\-openflowd\fR or \fBovs\-vswitch\fR is controlling: group
0 contains
all ports except those disabled by STP, and group 1 contains all
ports.  Additional or different groups might be used in the future.
.IP
This command is primarily useful for debugging Open vSwitch.  OpenFlow
does not have a concept of port groups.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-timeout=\fIsecs\fR
Limits \fBovs\-dpctl\fR runtime to approximately \fIsecs\fR seconds.  If
the timeout expires, \fBovs\-dpctl\fR will exit with a \fBSIGALRM\fR
signal.
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fImodule\fR[\fB:\fIfacility\fR[\fB:\fIlevel\fR]], \fB\-\-verbose=\fImodule\fR[\fB:\fIfacility\fR[\fB:\fIlevel\fR]]
.
Sets the logging level for \fImodule\fR in \fIfacility\fR to
\fIlevel\fR:
.
.RS
.IP \(bu
\fImodule\fR may be any valid module name (as displayed by the
\fB\-\-list\fR action on \fBovs\-appctl\fR(8)), or the special name
\fBANY\fR to set the logging levels for all modules.
.
.IP \(bu
\fIfacility\fR may be \fBsyslog\fR, \fBconsole\fR, or \fBfile\fR to
set the levels for logging to the system log, the console, or a file
respectively, or \fBANY\fR to set the logging levels for both
facilities.  If it is omitted, \fIfacility\fR defaults to \fBANY\fR.
.IP
Regardless of the log levels set for \fBfile\fR, logging to a file
will not take place unless \fB\-\-log\-file\fR is also specified (see
below).
.
.IP \(bu 
\fIlevel\fR must be one of \fBemer\fR, \fBerr\fR, \fBwarn\fR,
\fBinfo\fR, or
\fBdbg\fR, designating the minimum severity of a message for it to be
logged.  If it is omitted, \fIlevel\fR defaults to \fBdbg\fR.
.RE
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to
\fB\-\-verbose=ANY:ANY:dbg\fR.
.
.TP
\fB\-vPATTERN:\fIfacility\fB:\fIpattern\fR, \fB\-\-verbose=PATTERN:\fIfacility\fB:\fIpattern\fR
Sets the log pattern for \fIfacility\fR to \fIpattern\fR.  Refer to
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a description of the valid syntax for \fIpattern\fR.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-file\fR[\fB=\fIfile\fR]
Enables logging to a file.  If \fIfile\fR is specified, then it is
used as the exact name for the log file.  The default log file name
used if \fIfile\fR is omitted is \fB/usr/local/var/log/openvswitch/\*(PN.log\fR.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Prints a brief help message to the console.
.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Prints version information to the console.
.
.SH EXAMPLES
.
A typical \fBovs\-dpctl\fR command sequence for controlling an
Open vSwitch kernel module:
.
.TP
\fBovs\-dpctl add\-dp dp0\fR
Creates datapath number 0.
.
.TP
\fBovs\-dpctl add\-if dp0 eth0 eth1\fR
Adds two network devices to the new datapath.
.
.PP
At this point one would ordinarily start \fBovs\-openflowd\fR(8) on
\fBdp0\fR, transforming \fBdp0\fR into an OpenFlow switch.  Then, when
the switch and the datapath is no longer needed:
.
.TP
\fBovs\-dpctl del\-if dp0 eth0 eth1\fR
Removes network devices from the datapath.
.
.TP
\fBovs\-dpctl del\-dp dp0\fR
Deletes the datapath.
